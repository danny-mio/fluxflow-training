# Example flow training configurations for different scenarios

# Default noise-to-image training (0-1000 timesteps)
- name: "flow_noise_to_image"
  train_diff: true
  num_train_timesteps: 1000  # Default: full range
  start_step: 0  # Default: start from noise

# Img2img training (start from partially denoised images)
- name: "flow_img2img"
  train_diff: true
  num_train_timesteps: 500  # Shorter range for img2img
  start_step: 250  # Start from middle denoising (less noisy images)

# Fine-tuning with fewer timesteps
- name: "flow_finetune_quick"

  num_train_timesteps: 200  # Quick training
  start_step: 0  # Standard noise-to-image

# Advanced img2img (very noisy to moderately noisy)
- name: "flow_img2img_advanced"
  train_diff: true
  num_train_timesteps: 750  # Custom range
  start_step: 125  # Start from fairly noisy images
